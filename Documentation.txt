MealMasterApp.py

This file contains the main application class for the MealMaster application.

MealMaster is a recipe management application that allows users to keep track of their
ingredients, create and store recipes, and plan meals. The application is built with
Kivy, a cross-platform GUI library for Python, and uses a SQLite database to store
user data.

The main application class, MealMasterApp, inherits from the MDApp class provided
by the KivyMD library. This class provides a number of built-in features, such as
navigation bars, sliding panels, and dialog boxes, that simplify the development of
the user interface.

The build method of the MealMasterApp class creates a ScreenManager object, which
is used to manage the different screens that make up the application. The
MealMasterApp class also registers four screens with the ScreenManager: Menu,
Settings, Recipes, and Inventory. Each screen is a separate Kivy widget that
implements the Screen interface.

When the application is run, the MealMasterApp class's run method is called, which
starts the Kivy event loop and launches the GUI.

Overall, the MealMaster application is a complex example of a Python/Kivy GUI
application that demonstrates the use of a variety of Kivy features and libraries,
including KivyMD, to create a user-friendly interface for managing recipes and meal
planning.
